##Random Adventures
####A simple selection tool for choosing what to write about

This software was designed and built to make selecting writing options easier for young people.
It was initiated by an english teacher friend.

It is written on AngularJS.

** It is not perfect. Nor is it necessarily best practice. TBH, it's a simple project start-point. 
It could be extended to greater things, but I probably won't.
